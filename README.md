# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-for weather report
This project aims to analyze the temperature trends in India from 1901 to 2021, focusing on understanding both annual and monthly temperature variations. The analysis was performed using Python, utilizing libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for visualization, and Statsmodels for statistical modeling. 
The dataset, which provides historical temperature data for India, was initially cleaned to handle missing values and outliers. Descriptive statistics were calculated to assess the overall distribution of temperatures, identifying trends and patterns over the years. Time series analysis techniques were then applied to examine the long-term trends and seasonal variations in India's temperature data.
A key aspect of the analysis was to identify the temperature trends across different decades, which revealed periods of warming and cooling. Monthly temperature variations were also explored to understand seasonal changes and extreme temperature events, highlighting potential implications for agriculture, climate policy, and human health. 
To communicate the findings, interactive visualizations were created, enabling users to explore the data dynamically. These visualizations include line plots, heatmaps, and animated charts that allow for a deeper understanding of the data and its implications. This project provides valuable insights into India's climate trends and contributes to ongoing discussions on climate change and environmental sustainability.
